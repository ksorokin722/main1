The trajectory outlines the creation of a web application named Ublogger, intended to be a Russian-market competitor to influencer marketing platforms like . The development began with a user request to clone the competitor's site, focusing on a bright, blogger aesthetic with analytics and automation features.

The initial phase involved the AI engineer scaffolding a frontend-only application using React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI components, populated with mock data. This included creating a landing page with various sections like a hero, stats, how-it-works, top bloggers, and testimonials.

Following the initial build, the user requested the addition of a user account system, including registration and a dashboard, along with more social media-related visuals. The AI implemented this by adding new pages for authentication () and a user dashboard (), integrating routing, and creating a  component.

A subsequent request involved clarifying deployment procedures. The AI ran a production build (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.), provided the generated CSS file, and created a detailed .

The most recent and current task is a multi-part feature request. This includes building a profile settings page, adding an analytics dashboard with charts, fixing several UI and UX bugs (a mobile responsiveness issue, a double registration bug, and an incorrect click behavior on a stats section), and implementing a loyalty program. The AI has started this work by creating the necessary files (, , ) and installing dependencies like  for the charts. The work is currently in progress.

The current work is focused on implementing a large multi-part feature and bug-fix request from the user (Message 71). The primary goal is to build out the user dashboard functionality.

So far, the foundational frontend structure for these new features has been established:
1.  **Profile Settings Page:** The file  has been created. This component is intended to contain the form for users to manage their personal information, social media links, and payment details. The UI and logic for this form have not yet been implemented.
2.  **Analytics Dashboard:** The file  has been created. This component will house the data visualizations for advertising campaign metrics. The necessary charting library, , has been successfully installed as a dependency.
3.  **Authentication State:** A global state management solution has been initiated with the creation of . This will be used to manage the user's session across the application.
4.  **Routing:** The main router in  has been updated to include the new pages and wrap the application in the .
5. Give full access to build folder.

The AI engineer had just completed these structural changes and dependency installations when the user prompted to continue. The immediate next steps involve building the actual UI and logic within these newly created components.
